## Overview

Prompt Line is a macOS app developed to improve the prompt input experience in the terminal for CLI-based AI coding agents such as [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider).
It addresses UX challenges related to multi-byte character input (e.g., Japanese) by providing a dedicated floating input interface. 

This greatly reduces stress when entering text in the following cases in particular. 

1. **Prompt input for CLI-based AI coding agents in the terminal** 
2. **Chat apps where pressing Enter sends the message at an unintended time** 
3. **Text editor with slow input response (e.g., large Confluence documents)**


## Features

### Quick Launch, Quick Paste
Quick launch with shortcut (`Cmd+Shift+Space`).<br>
Type text and quick paste (`Cmd+Enter`).

### Perfect for Editing Voice-Inputted Text
The operation is the same as a typical text editor. <br>
Of course, you can also use it in combination with a voice input app. <br>
Pressing Enter will not automatically send the text, so you don't have to worry about line breaks. <br>
It is also ideal for editing text entered by voice. <br>

### Search and Reuse Prompt History
Prompt history is saved and can be reused from the right menu. <br>
Search is also available. (`Cmd+f`)

### Launch Anywhere
Can be launched anywhere there's a text input field. <br>
Also convenient when you want to reuse the same prompt in other apps.

Of course, it also works with apps other than Terminal.
