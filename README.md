## Overview

Prompt Line is a macOS app developed to improve the prompt input experience in the terminal for CLI-based AI coding agents such as [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider).
It addresses UX challenges related to multi-byte character input (e.g., Japanese) by providing a dedicated floating input interface. 

This greatly reduces stress when entering text in the following cases in particular. 

1. **Prompt input for CLI-based AI coding agents in the terminal** 
2. **Chat apps where pressing Enter sends the message at an unintended time** 
3. **Text editor with slow input response (e.g., large Confluence documents)**


## Features

### Quick Launch, Quick Paste
Quick launch with shortcut (`Cmd+Shift+Space`).<br>
Type text and quick paste (`Cmd+Enter`).

### Perfect for Editing Voice-Inputted Text
The operation is the same as a typical text editor. <br>
Of course, you can also use it in combination with a voice input app. <br>
Pressing Enter will not automatically send the text, so you don't have to worry about line breaks. <br>
It is also ideal for editing text entered by voice. <br>

### Search and Reuse Prompt History
Prompt history is saved and can be reused from the right menu. <br>
Search is also available. (`Cmd+f`)

### Launch Anywhere
Can be launched anywhere there's a text input field. <br>
Also convenient when you want to reuse the same prompt in other apps.

3. The issue should be resolved after reconfiguring settings.

Accessibility permissions can also be reset using the following command:
```bash
npm run reset-accessibility
```
